# MNIST-ImageRecognitionV2

This is my second attempt at the MNIST dataset. My goal this time around was to learn Tensorflow, get experience with convolutional neural networks (CNN), and achieve a 99% or better accuracy. After trying many different architectures, I chose a model that had 3 CNN layers, 2 pooling layers, 2 fully connected layers, and 2 dropout layers. I used the Nesterov Accelerated Gradient optimizer. 

This model in addition to data augmentation that grew the training data from 60,000 images to 900,000 images created a model that achieved an accuracy of 99.2%.
